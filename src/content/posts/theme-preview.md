description: What do they got in there? King Kong? You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager? I was part of something special. Did he just throw my cat out of the window? Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose.

Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! I was part of something special.

My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!

Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows. Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don’t eat the tourists.

Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don’t eat the tourists. Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows.

$$
evidence\_{i}=\sum\_{j}W\_{ij}x\_{j}+b\_{i}
$$

$$
AveP = \int_0^1 p(r) dr
$$

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
